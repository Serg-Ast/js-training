Me. I'm a guy who thinks he knows JS.

## Why?

----

There are many ways to code in javascript.

----

Many of them are WRONG!

Knowing how to cut tomatoes, turn on the oven, make a tortilla does not mean you are a good cook ...

You just know stuff.

----

Knowing to loop, to use functions or to create objects does not mean you are a good JS developer...

You just know stuff.

----

You don't know JS. But you don't know it yet.

---

## How ?

----

A few steps

----

**1. Fail the exam** or leave the room

----

**2. Attend classes**: listen, ask, and ask again

----

**3. Do your homework** with the refactor project

* Repo: https://github.com/soyundev/js-training-practice
* Deadline: Send your pull request before wednesday

----

**4. Pass the exam** or blame you... and me.
